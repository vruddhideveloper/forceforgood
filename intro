Life is truly meaningful when we can create a long-lasting impact on those in need, and this belief is what drives me to apply for the Force for Good program. In an era where technology has advanced beyond our imagination, its true value lies in how it can solve fundamental challenges and empower the most vulnerable in our society. I have previously worked on projects to support visually impaired individuals, and through this program, I aspire to build impactful AI technologies that address global challenges like access to education, equity, and social welfare.
My motivation to join Force for Good stems from a simple yet powerful belief: technology should be used to make a real difference in people’s lives. I’ve always been inspired by how AI can solve problems that truly matter—improving accessibility for differently-abled individuals, enhancing education, and making healthcare more reachable for underserved communities. I am excited to bring fresh, creative ideas to the table—like developing AI solutions to help nonprofits optimize resources or creating tools that directly improve lives. What excites me most is the opportunity to transform my technical skills into something meaningful, collaborating with others who share the same passion for using technology as a force for good. For me, it’s not just about building systems; it’s about creating a lasting, positive impact.


"Through Force for Good, I want to grow as a leader by learning how to lead diverse teams and collaborate effectively on meaningful projects. I aim to improve my client and stakeholder management skills, aligning tech solutions with real-world needs. This program will also help me refine my communication and mentoring abilities, empowering me to create impactful solutions that truly make a difference in communities."

Past year, I witnessed a tragic incident that left an indelible mark on me. An elderly man with visual disabilities was trying to cross the road but was unable to do so on his own. Despite the crowd around him, no one came forward to help. Before I could react, a rash driver struck him, and the man tragically lost his life on the spot. I could not sleep that night, replaying the scene and questioning the role of technology in our world. It dawned on me that while technology has advanced tremendously, its impact is meaningless if it cannot help humanity at its most vulnerable moments.

This incident inspired me to create Smart Vision AI, a wearable system aimed at empowering visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings independently and safely. I began by understanding the specific challenges faced by visually impaired individuals and researching existing assistive technologies to identify gaps. Leveraging AI and computer vision, I designed a solution using Single Shot Detector (SSD) for real-time object detection and TensorFlow for model development. The device integrated lightweight hardware, including a Raspberry Pi and a camera module, to provide live audio feedback about the user’s surroundings. I actively engaged with visually impaired individuals and collaborated with NGOs to test the prototype in real-world scenarios, gathering invaluable feedback to iteratively improve its usability and impact.

Overcoming challenges like model overfitting and latency, I applied advanced training techniques and hardware optimizations to enhance performance. After rigorous testing and refinement, the final prototype achieved over 90% accuracy in real-time detection, enabling users to navigate safely and independently.
