Life is truly meaningful when we can create a long-lasting impact on those in need, and this belief is what drives me to apply for the Force for Good program. In an era where technology has advanced beyond our imagination, its true value lies in how it can solve fundamental challenges and empower the most vulnerable in our society. I have previously worked on projects to support visually impaired individuals, and through this program, I aspire to build impactful AI technologies that address global challenges like access to education, equity, and social welfare.
My motivation to join Force for Good stems from a simple yet powerful belief: technology should be used to make a real difference in people’s lives. I’ve always been inspired by how AI can solve problems that truly matter—improving accessibility for differently-abled individuals, enhancing education, and making healthcare more reachable for underserved communities. I am excited to bring fresh, creative ideas to the table—like developing AI solutions to help nonprofits optimize resources or creating tools that directly improve lives. What excites me most is the opportunity to transform my technical skills into something meaningful, collaborating with others who share the same passion for using technology as a force for good. For me, it’s not just about building systems; it’s about creating a lasting, positive impact.


"Through Force for Good, I want to grow as a leader by learning how to lead diverse teams and collaborate effectively on meaningful projects. I aim to improve my client and stakeholder management skills, aligning tech solutions with real-world needs. This program will also help me refine my communication and mentoring abilities, empowering me to create impactful solutions that truly make a difference in communities."
